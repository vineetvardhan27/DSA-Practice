## Getting Started

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Or run a local server: `python -m http.server 8000` and visit `http://localhost:8000`
3. Navigate between Arrays, Strings, and Graphs sections
4. Use search to find specific problems
5. Click any problem card to open the LeetCode link

## Adding New Questions

Edit the `questions.json` file to add new problems:

```json
{
  "arrays": [
    {
      "id": 38,
      "title": "Your New Problem",
      "description": "Problem description here...",
      "type": "Algorithm Type",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "link": "https://leetcode.com/problems/your-problem/"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Dynamic Problem Management

You can also add problems programmatically:

```javascript
// Add a new problem to arrays section
DSAPractice.addProblem('arrays', {
    title: "New Array Problem",
    description: "Description of the problem...",
    type: "Two Pointers",
    difficulty: "easy",
    link: "https://leetcode.com/problems/new-problem/"
});

// Update a problem's link
DSAPractice.updateProblemLink(problemId, "https://new-link.com");
```
